##Features of b4st

* A starter CSS theme – `/theme/css/b4st.css`, enqueued.
* WordPress menu and WordPress search form in the Bootstrap 4 `.navbar` (Note: Bootstrap 4 navbar dropdowns supports only two levels of menu links (no sub-sub menus).
* Bootstrap pagination for blog index and blog category pages.
* Bootstrap pagination for posts/pages if split over a series of 'pages'.
* Visual editor stylesheet `editor.css` – into which the same Bootstrap 4 and b4st starter CSS theme are preloaded by `@import`, so that what you see in the visual editor is (mostly) what you get at the front end (WYSI(M)WYG). E.g. you will see the theme's typpography in the WordPress Post/Page editor, but its width will not be the same as your article column width in the front end.
