##Features of b4st

* WordPress menu and WordPress search form in the Bootstrap 4 `.navbar` (Note: Bootstrap 4.0.0 supports only one level of menu links (no navbar drop-downs).
* Bootstrap pagination ( e.g. ` 1 | 2 | 3 | Older -> `) for Blog index and category pages.
* Visual editor stylesheet – into which the same Bootstrap 4 and starter CSS theme are preloaded by `@import`, so that what you see in the visual editor is (mostly!) what you get at the front end (WYSI(M!)WYG). E.g. you will see the theme's typpography in the WordPress Post/Page editor, but its width will not be the same as your article column width in the front end.
