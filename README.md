#b4st - A Bootstrap 4 Starter Theme, for WordPress

*Version 1.2.1*

------------------

**b4st is a simple WordPress starter theme loaded with Bootstrap 4.**

> **NOTE:** Bootstrap v4.0.0-alpha.2 is in the `dist/` folder. When Bootstrap is updated, you can simply swap for a newer `dist/` folder. But since Bootstrap v4 is still in alpha, they may yet change stuff that will require changes in the CSS classes in b4st.
