#b4st - A Bootstrap 4 Starter Theme, for WordPress

*Version 1.3*

------------------

**b4st is a simple WordPress starter theme loaded with Bootstrap 4.**

> **NOTE:** Bootstrap v4.0.0-alpha.2 is in the `dist/` folder. When Bootstrap is updated, you can simply swap for a newer `dist/` folder. But since Bootstrap v4 is still in alpha, they may yet change stuff that will require changes in b4st.

##Features of b4st

* Simple, intuitive, clean code.
* Bootstrap, theme CSS and JS, functions and loops are organized into different folders.
* **Bootstrap 4.0.0-alpha.2** – included CSS and JS enqueued.
* **jQuery** enqueued, served from the WordPress onboard (pre-registered) jQuery.
* **Font Awesome** (served by cdnjs.com CDN) enqueued.
* **Modernizr 2.8.3** (served by cdnjs.com CDN) enqueued.
* **Navbar with dropdowns (child menus)**. Note: Bootstrap 4.0.0-alpha2 does not have dropdown menus included in the [navbar](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/components/navbar/), therefore [dropdowns](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/components/dropdowns/) have been incorporated into the navbar. 
* A starter CSS theme – `/theme/css/b4st.css`, enqueued.
* WordPress menu and WordPress search form in the Bootstrap 4 `.navbar` (Note: Bootstrap 4.0.0-alpha.2 supports only one level of menu links (no navbar drop-downs).
* Bootstrap pagination for blog index and blog category pages.
* Bootstrap pagination for posts/pages if split over a series of 'pages'.
* Visual editor stylesheet – into which the same Bootstrap 4 and starter CSS theme are preloaded by `@import`, so that what you see in the visual editor is (mostly!) what you get at the front end (WYSI(M!)WYG). E.g. you will see the theme's typpography in the WordPress Post/Page editor, but its width will not be the same as your article column width in the front end.
